Changelog:
  Developer Build 2015.0.1 …
    Began to write the mechanum drive code, in theory done. Also, I have
    divirged from the way that the robot has been coded in the past, now (at
    least to me) it makes more sense, but I am not sure if it works.
    
  Developer Build 2015.0.2 …
    Wrote the arm lift API. It will lift till it hits a limit switch and
    then stop. Works for both up and down, and any amount of limit switches.
    Assumes we put a limit switch at the starting point. Will not go lower
    than intended, need to make it so it does not go higher than intended.
  
  Developer Build 2015.0.3 …
    Made it so the lift will not go heigher than intended.
    
  Developer Build 2015.0.4 …
    Wrote in the code for the buttons.
    
  Developer Build 2015.0.5 …
    Wrote in the grabber code. It will now close when you press a button
    and open when you press another. It will also not be
    able to close or open after you send a certain amount of voltage.
    
  Developer Build 2015.0.6 …
    Wrote the code for the buttons to run the grabbers. They are the left
    and right bumpers. Also did the proper versioning.

  Developer Build 2015.0.7
    Rewrote the code for the grabber so that it works with the triggers
    instead of the bumpers. Also removed the prior bumper code. It may not
    work...  

  Developer Build 2015.0.7.5
    Nate is an idiot. He set the trigger to get the wrong axis. This is
    fixing that.

  Developer Build 2015.0.8
    Fixed all the bugs with the code. The robot will drive if the code is
    uploaded to the robot. Also, you can choose which subsystems to run.
  
  Developer Build 2015.0.9
    Created a universal CAN/Talon object. Might work, haven't tested with
    Talons yet. Also, fixed some lasting bugs in the code.
    
  Developer Build 2015.1.0
    Added a deadban and a scaler. The drive code is done.
